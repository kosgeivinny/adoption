<b>WHO CAN ADOPT</b><br>

Adoption in Kenya is governed by the Hague Adoption Convention. Therefore to adopt from Kenya, you must first be found eligible to the Kenyan Government.
In addition to these, Kenya also has the following requirements for prospective adoptive parents:<br>

<b>Residency Requirements:</b> After the placement, the prospective adoptive parents must reside in Kenya with the child for at least three months before Kenyan legal procedures begin.
<br>

<b>Age Requirements:</b> One of the applicants must be more than 25 years old and more than 21 years older than the child and less than 65 years.
<br>
<b>Marriage Requirements:</b> Adoption orders will not be granted to a single male applicant. However, for single female applicants, the courts make a determination when there are special circumstances. Under Kenyan law, adoption orders will not be granted to joint applicants not married to each other.

<br>
The applicants can be a relative.
<br>
Prospective adoptive parents must be of sound mind, as defined by the Kenyan Mental Health Act.
<br>
Under Kenyan law, adoption orders will not be granted to applicant(s) who have been charged and convicted by a court of competent jurisdiction for or of any offence against children under Kenyan laws.  (Note: USCIS also requires a criminal background check to be done on all petitioners and may find families ineligible as well).
<br>
Under Kenyan law, adoption orders will not be granted to gay and lesbian individuals or couples.

<br><br>

<b>WHO CAN BE ADOPTED</b>
<br>
Because Kenya is party to the Hague Adoption Convention, children from Kenya must meet the requirements of the Convention in order to be eligible for adoption.  
<br>

<b>ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS:</b>
<br>
<b>Age Requirements:</b> Child(ren) must be at least 6 weeks old and declared free for adoption by a registered adoption society
 <br>

<b>Consent Must be Obtained as Follows:</b>  
<br>            
1.  If applicable, from existing parents, guardians or any one else contributing to the maintenance of the child under any agreement or order; 
<br>
2.  If applicable, from parents or guardian(s) of the mother of the child in a case where the mother is a minor;
<br>
3.  If applicable, from the step-father who has acquired parental responsibility
<br>
4.  From the spouse of the prospective adoptive parent, if the spouse is not available in person.
 
<br><br>
<b>HOW TO ADOPT</b>
<br>
<b>Kenya’s Adoption Authority</b>
<br>
The government office responsible for adoptions in Kenya is the High Court and the Department of Children’s Services.
<br><br>

<b>Our online process:</b>
<br>
Because Kenya is party to the Hague Adoption Convention, adopting from Kenya must follow a specific process designed to meet the Convention’s requirements.   A brief summary of the Convention adoption process is given below.  You must complete these steps in the following order so that your adoption meets all necessary legal requirements.
<br>
<b> Our Adoption Process has the following steps:</b>
<br>
1.	Choose an Accredited Children’s home from displayed list online.
<br>
2.	Apply to be Found Eligible to Adopt.
<br>
3.	Select a child to be Matched with.
<br>
4.	Fill in the provided form online.
<br>
5.	Wait for confirmation from the children’s home staff.
<br>
6.	If confirmed, visit the children’s home and comply with the staff on how to take the child home.
<br>
 
<b>Duties of the Guardian/Adopter:</b>
<br>
1.    Safeguard the interests of the child pending the determination of the adoption proceedings;
<br>
2.    Investigate and appraise the court as to the circumstances pertinent to the adoption of the child in the prescribed manner;
<br>
3.    Make recommendations as to the priority of making any interim orders or an adoption order in respect of the child;
<br>
4.    Intervene on behalf of the child and arrange for the care of the child in the event of the withdrawal of any consent;
<br>
5.    Undertake such duties as the court may direct.
<br>
Where arrangements for adoption of any child have been made by the Child Welfare Society of Kenya, neither the society nor any member thereof shall be appointed Guardian of the same child.

<br>
Certificate from the enlisted social or child welfare agency sponsoring the application of the foreigner to the effect that the prospective adoptive parents are permitted to adopt a child according to the laws of their country.
